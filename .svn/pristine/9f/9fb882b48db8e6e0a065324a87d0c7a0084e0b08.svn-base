      Croon is a weekly competition app where people can upload or record audio or video clips (up to 1 minute in length) of themselves singing, dancing, playing sports, playing video games, etc.  The competitions are judged by other users (the voters).  Contestants have up to a specified time every week to upload or record their audio/video clips.  Then the voters get to vote on their favorite performer(s) up to a specified time.  We tally the winners and announce the results at the end of the week.

      Contestants can compete as many times as they want.  The app also allows contestants to ping their friends to encourage them to come and vote for them.

      Voters can vote as many times as they wish (but not for the same video/audio clip more than once per week).
    </li>

      The app will send a daily update with a running tally of the vote count to all contestants and voters.

      Croon will maintain a list of previous winners so that you can go back and re-experience your past favorites.
